        "Math, and especially Geometry has always been at the heart of my academic interests.  From high school geometry to Computer Aided Design modeling to data science, I've always had a fascination and keen interest in bringing to life visualizations of mathematical 'things', for lack of a better term.",
        "In the pictures below you can see some of the fractal images that can be brought to life with coding, in this case Python.  I was able to generate these images through one of the tutorials in the links below.  The implementation of the mathematics in python is relatively straight forward.  However, the real trick to generating interesting images is finding an interesting location and zoom factor on the Mandelbrot set, then tinkering with an intersting color spectrum, pixel density, and something called 'stability' in the iterative calculation process.  It takes quite a bit of trial and error, but with a little bit of patience you can generate some brilliant images.",
        "A little aside about my journey in learning to code...a skill that isn't talked about and taught enough is reading other people's code.  I've learned so much about my own 'style' and weaknesses by working through approaches other people have taken.  Without looking at other people's code and learning from thier approaches, it is very easy to fall into a rut of reinventing wheels and tackling every problem with a hammer.  This is not good in software engineering.  It's critical to build upon what is out there and expand the frontier.  For example, in walking through this tutorial I saw valuable uses of list comprehensions, and also discovered that Python has data class that can be quite useful.",
        "There are some wonderful tutorials online, as well as some wonderful videos explaining the mathematics behind some specific fractals such as the Mandelbrot set.  Below are some links to a Python tutorial as well some of my favorite videos.  I love everything that 3Blue1Brown puts out on mathematics, so definitely check him out.  Enjoy!!",
