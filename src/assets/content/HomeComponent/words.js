        "I have an analytical mindset and a strong interest in math.  This led me to the University of Colorado where I studied Mechanical Engineering as an undergraduate.",
        "Much of my time at CU was spent in the UNIX workstation lab building 3D models, computing stress and strain of mechanical systems, and modeling temperature gradients and fluid flow.  To accomplished all of this I used high level cuttent edge software like Finite Element Analysis (FEA), Computer Aided Drafting (CAD), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and Matlab.",        
        "One of my favorite courses at CU was an introduction to Computer Science which taught us the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms through programming in C++.",
        "It was impossible to see my future career at the time, however, my time spent in the computer lab laid a strong foundation in analysis, data, and computation.  As my career developed, my focus shifted from mechanical systems to utilizing software to solve all kinds of problems."

        "Early in my career I received my first exposure to business and quickly saw that financial acumen was crucial to good decision making.  Also, it's the Achilles heel of many otherwise good engineers.  My interest in economics was piqued and I began to sense the liberating advantages in disciplined investment analysis.",
        "At this time the world began to change in a big way.  The financial industry was entering the era of ‘big data’ and was calling for analytical skills and computing saavy.  Given my technical background and interest in economics, getting an MBA was a unexpected next step for me.",
        "At Notre Dame I found a wonderful community of disciplined, intellectually curious learners.  At this great institution I was exposed to financial thinkers like Warren Buffett and became fascinated by investing and building economic prosperity."
