        "I have an analytical mindset and a strong interest in math.  This led me to the University of Colorado where I studied Mechanical Engineering as an undergraduate.",
        "Much of my time at CU was spent in the UNIX workstation lab where I used cutting edge software to build 3D models (Computer Aided Drafting - CAD), compute stress and strain of mechanical systems (Finite Element Analysis - FEA), calculate mathematical solutions with Matlab, and model and temperature gradients and fluid flow (Computation Fluid Dynamics - CFD).",
        "One of my favorite courses at CU was a Computer Science course which taught us the fundamentals of Data Structures and Algorithms through programming in C++.",
        "It was impossible to see my future career at the time, however, my time spent in the computer lab laid a strong foundation in analysis, data, computation, and hardware.  My focus shifted from mechanical systems to utilizing software tools to solve problems."

        "The world has changed so fast over the last ~20 years.  I like to think back to the early 1900’s when humanity flew for the first time, illuminated the world with electricity, developed the automobile and the assembly line, made huge advances in medicine, and began to communicate across the world in real time through radio and television.  These technological advancements led to “the roaring 20’s”, a period of rapid economic growth. The parallels of “the roaring ’20’s” with the technological and economic advancements today are fascinating to contemplate and hard to ignore.  This new technology economy is calling for people with a diverse skill set and broad knowledge base. I want to be one of those people on the cutting edge.",
