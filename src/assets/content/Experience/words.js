        `In ExxonMobil’s world class employee development program I saw first hand the operational magnitude required to convert oil into economically viable products for humanity.`,
        `I worked at the 5th largest oil refinery in the United States located in Beaumont, TX.  There I served as the ‘right-hand-man’ to the Executive leadership team, analyzing data and generating useful information to support leadership decisions on a large scale.`

        `This is West Texas, the epicenter of a major oil production renaissance beginning in the mid 2000s.  During this renaissance the US began to double it's oil production capacity and, by 2018, became the world’s largest oil producer surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.`,
        `I took this picture while flying into the Midland, TX airport.  You can see the oil fields stretching out to the horizon in all directions.`

        `The amount of steel, water, raw materials, and energy needed to extract oil from the ground boggles my mind to this day.  I lived it, but I still can't quite put it in perspective.  In the picture you can see tank batteries, pumps, and power lines stretching out for hundreds of miles into the West Texas desert.`

    champion: [
        `I built dashboards to help Executives monitor daily activity of ExxonMobil's fleet of drill-ships deployed all around the globe.`,
        `Pictured here is the Deepwater Champion which has sailed to the Gulf of Mexico, the Black Sea, off the coast of Africa, and more.`

        `Contracts on these large drill-ships cost upwards of half-a-million dollars per day and more, and are often times contracted for multiple years at a time.  Getting the negotiations right and leveraging data for market intelligence could result in ten’s-of-millions of dollars in savings for ExxonMobil.`

    rigs:[
        `This image illustrates all of the activity supporting drilling new wells.  There are 6 rigs in a line actively drilling new wells and you can get a sense of the crews needed, and raw materials.`,
        `If you look closely you can see drill pipe and drill string staged for use in the operation.  Drill string and pipe are steel sections placed into the well sequentially.  Sourcing this steel on a large scale is another sourcing puzzle, especially in dynamic commodity markets.`

    frac:[
        `This is an active frac, or hydraulic fracturing operation.  Here the crew is injection water and sand into a recently drilled new well.`,
        `Another illustration of the energy, raw materials and hard work.  You can see huge boxes of sand, truck loads of water, and massive pumps all used in the operation.`

    pond:[
        `One of the major bottlenecks to oil production and development is water management.`,
        `Oil & gas wells produce brackish water that needs to be pumped back down water disposal wells or cleaned up and reused in fracing new wells.`

    pond2:[
        `Water is used in drilling new wells to flush 'chips' out of the bore as well as in fracing operations.`,
        `Managing sourcing, transportation (trucks, pipelines), and disposal of all this water is a logistical puzzle.`,
        `Generally when developing new fields you have too much water where you don't need it (production), and not enough water where you do need it (fracing new development).`
    ],
    powerlines:[
        `This picture doesn't look like much, but I took this on my commute to the office.  Each oil well requires power/electricity to operate the pump (pumpjack/'nodding donkey') to make oil flow.`,
        `To achieve this, companies contiunually have to work with Electric/Power Companies to source electricity and expand the reach of the 'grid'.  If you look closely on the horizon it looks as if there is almost no end to the lines.`,
