        `In ExxonMobil’s world class employee development program I saw first hand the operational magnitude required to convert oil into economically viable products for humanity.`,
        `I worked at the 5th largest oil refinery in the United States located in Beaumont, TX.  There I served as the ‘right-hand-man’ to the Executive leadership team, analyzing data and generating useful information to support leadership decisions on a large scale.`

        `This is West Texas, the epicenter of a major energy cycle beginning in around 2010.  During this cycle the US began to double it's oil production capacity and, by 2018, became the world’s largest oil producer surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.`,
        `I took this picture while flying into the Midland, TX airport which has left a lasting impression on me.  From the sky you can see the oil fields stretching out to the horizon in all directions.`

        `The amount of steel, water, raw materials, and energy needed to extract oil from the ground boggles my mind to this day.  I lived it, but I still can't quite put it in perspective.  In the picture you can see tank batteries, pumps, and power lines stretching out for hundreds of miles into the West Texas desert.`

    champion: [
        `I built dashboards to help Executives monitor daily activity of ExxonMobil's fleet of drill-ships deployed all around the globe.`,
        `Pictured here is the Deepwater Champion which has sailed to the Gulf of Mexico, the Black Sea, off the coast of Africa, and more.`

    acquarius: [
        `Contracts on these large drill-ships cost upwards of half-a-million dollars per day and more, and are often times contracted for multiple years at a time.  Getting the negotiations right and leveraging data for market intelligence could result in ten’s-of-millions of dollars in savings for ExxonMobil.`

    rigs:[
        `This image give a hint of all of the activity supporting drilling new wells.  There are 6 rigs in a line actively drilling new wells and you can see the crews needed, raw materials, and overall activity that goes into bringing new oil production online.`,
        `If you look closely you can see drill pipe and drill string staged for use in the operation.  I am still struck by how much steel in consumed in creating a new oil well.  Sourcing this steel on a large scale is another supply chain puzzle, especially in dynamic commodity markets.`
    ],
    frac:[
        `This is an active frac, or hydraulic fracturing operation.  Here the crew is injection water and sand into a recently drilled new well.`,
        `Another illustration of the energy, raw materials and hard work.  You can see huge boxes of sand, truck loads of water, and massive pumps all used in the operation.`
    ],
    pond:[
        `One of the major bottlenecks to oil production and development is water management.`,
        `Oil & gas wells produce brackish water that either needs to be pumped back down water disposal wells, or filted and reused in fracing new wells.`,
        `The logistics behind moving all of this water is a large undertaking and something I had no notion of before relocating to Midland.`
    ],
    pond2:[
        `This is another picture for context on the water used in oil field operations.`,
        `Water is used in drilling new wells to flush 'chips' out of the bore as well as in fracing operations.`,
        `Generally when developing new fields you have too much water where you don't need it (production), and not enough water where you do need it (fracing new development).`,
        `Managing sourcing, transportation (trucks, pipelines), and disposal of all this water is a gigantic logistical puzzle.`,
    ],
    powerlines:[
        `This picture doesn't look like much, but I took this on my commute to the office one morning.  Each oil well requires power/electricity to operate the pump (pumpjack/'nodding donkey').  This pump is what makes oil flow out of the ground.`,
        `To achieve this, companies contiunually have to work with Electric/Power Companies to source electricity and expand the reach of the 'grid'.  If you look closely on the horizon you can see a multitude of powerlines.`,
        `This was another factor in energy production that I really had no notion of prior to moving to Midland.`

        `The scale and raw materials moving throughout the desert still boggles my mind to this day.`
