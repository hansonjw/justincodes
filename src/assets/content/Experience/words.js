        `At ExxonMobil I leveraged big data, code, technology, and data science to drive insightful Business Intelligence and inform sound economic decisions.`,

        `In ExxonMobil's world-class employee development program, I saw firsthand the operational magnitude required to convert oil into economically viable products for humanity.`,
        `In my first role with the company, I worked at the fifth-largest oil refinery in the United States, located in Beaumont, TX. There, I served as the "right-hand man" to the executive leadership team, analyzing data and generating useful information to support leadership decisions on a large scale.`

        `This is West Texas, the epicenter of a major energy cycle that began around 2010. During this cycle, the US began to double its oil production capacity and, by 2018, became the world's largest oil producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia.`,
        `I took this picture while flying into the Midland, TX airport, which left a lasting impression on me. From the sky, you can see the oil fields stretching out to the horizon in all directions.`

    permian: [
        `The amount of steel, water, raw materials, and energy needed to extract oil from the ground boggles my mind to this day.  I lived it, but I still can't quite put it in perspective.  In the picture you can see tank batteries, pumps, and power lines stretching out for hundreds of miles into the West Texas desert.`

    champion: [
        `I built dashboards to help executives monitor the daily activity of ExxonMobil's fleet of drillships deployed all around the globe.`,
        `Pictured here is the Deepwater Champion, which has sailed to the Gulf of Mexico, the Black Sea, off the coast of Africa, and more.`
    ],
    acquarius: [
        `Contracts for these large drillships cost upwards of half a million dollars per day or more and are often contracted for multiple years at a time. Getting the negotiations right and leveraging data for market intelligence could result in tens of millions of dollars in savings for ExxonMobil.`
    ],
    rigs:[
        `This image gives a hint of all the activity supporting the drilling of new wells. There are six rigs in a line actively drilling new wells, and you can see the crews needed, raw materials, and overall activity that goes into bringing new oil production online.`,
        `If you look closely, you can see drill pipe and drill string staged for use in the operation. I am still struck by how much steel is consumed in creating a new oil well. Sourcing this steel on a large scale is another supply chain puzzle, especially in dynamic commodity markets.`
    ],
    frac:[
        `This is an active frac or hydraulic fracturing operation. Here, the crew is injecting water and sand into a recently drilled new well.`,
        `This is another illustration of the energy, raw materials, and hard work involved. You can see huge boxes of sand, truckloads of water, and massive pumps all used in the operation.`
    ],
    pond:[
        `One of the major bottlenecks to oil production and development is water management.`,
        `Oil and gas wells produce brackish water that either needs to be pumped back down water disposal wells or filtered and reused in fracking new wells.`,
        `The logistics behind moving all of this water is a large undertaking and something I had no notion of before relocating to Midland.`
    ],
    pond2:[
        `This is another picture for context on the water used in oil field operations.`,
        `Water is used in drilling new wells to flush out "chips" from the bore, as well as in fracking operations.`,
        `Generally, when developing new fields, you have too much water where you don't need it (in production) and not enough water where you do need it (in fracking new development).`,
        `Managing sourcing, transportation (via trucks or pipelines), and disposal of all this water is a gigantic logistical puzzle.`
    ],
    powerlines:[
        `This picture doesn't look like much, but I took it on my commute to the office one morning. Each oil well requires power or electricity to operate the pump (pumpjack/'nodding donkey'), which is what makes oil flow out of the ground.`,
        `To achieve this, companies continually have to work with electric/power companies to source electricity and expand the reach of the grid. If you look closely on the horizon, you can see a multitude of power lines.`,
        `This was another factor in energy production that I really had no notion of prior to moving to Midland.`
    ],
    midland2:[
        `Here's another picture I took while flying out of Midland. The vastness of the landscape and the amount of raw materials being transported through the desert continue to amaze me to this day. It's a constant reminder of the enormous effort and resources required to extract and transport oil from these remote locations.`
