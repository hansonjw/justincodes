It's almost startling how close you are allowed to get to everything happening down there!"],
        maroonbells:["This is the famous 'Marroon Bells' just outside of Aspen, CO.", "Having grown up in Colorado I'll always love and appreciate the mountains...especially in the summertime."],
        starbase:["Starbase, Texas is an R&D facility for SpaceX located on the far Southern Tip of Texas.  Here SpaceX is developing the rockets and technology to take humanity to the Moon and Mars.", "The 'Starbase' sign is a popular tourist stop and photo opportunity. The top of this long sign is tiled in solar panels."],
        mechazilla:["This is a view from Boca Chica Beach looking back at the SpaceX launch complex.", "The launch-and-catch-structure has been nicknamed 'Mechazilla' and is almost 400 feet tall by my estimation.", "In the picture you can also see a heavy booster and a 'Starship' on the ground by the cranes."],
        stream:["This was a great little hike in Pfieffer Big Sur State Park in central California.  This was my first encounter with the redwood trees in California.", "Here the seeds were planted for a return trip to California to visit the Redwood Parks up North."],
        brk:["Studying the writings of Warren Buffett has been one of the most import steps in my development as a business professional.", "In 2016 I attended the Berkshire Hathaway Annual meeting where I saw Mr. Buffett speak in person.", "That was quite a thrill!"],

This massive rocket is required to propel just three men to the moon!"],
        cash:["This is Cash.  We found him in the bushes of the house across the street.  We took him in, nursed him back to health, and started working with a local animal rescue to find him a permanent home.","Happy to report that Cash was adopted by a great home!"],
        cashmace:["On the same day we met Cash, Mace (larger eared kitten on the right) came to our doorstep.

It has been such a joy to see him transform into the friendly and fun loving kitten he has become."],
        solar:["On a recent road trip through California we stopped at this charging station between Las Vegas and San Luis Obispo.  It is a very large station with ~40+ charging stalls in the middle of the desert.","It felt very far from civilization, yet the solar panels and EV charging felt so very futuristic. It was such a striking contrast to many of the sites I have seen while working in the oil industry for over a decade.', 'Hard not to think about how far civilization is advancing in our lifetimes. What better time to be alive!"],
